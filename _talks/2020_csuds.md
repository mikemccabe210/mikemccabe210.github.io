From clinician-level analysis of medical imaging, to precision medicine powered by fine-grained genomic models, to automated drug discovery, it often seems like machine learning is only a few years away from completely transforming healthcare as we know it. While progress is certainly being made, in practice, the healthcare industry is an enormously complicated beast that is more resistant to change than one might expect from browsing arXiv.  In this talk, I will discuss the structure of the healthcare industry, where organizations are currently deriving value from data science, and the complications that arise when trying to translate hype into improved care. We'll explore a few use cases spanning both the clinical and business side of healthcare, focusing on problems shared by both large research institutions and smaller community hospitals and cover some specific technical and data challenges frequently faced by healthcare organizations as they start exploring data science.
